          purchase to delivery at your destination. Items that take more than
          two weeks to be delivered to our U.K. Warehouse by the seller may take
          up to 45 Business days to deliver in Kenya If they are delivered by
          ship, and it will take a maximum of 1 - 2 weeks if they are delivered

          <h1 className="services__heading">Shipping Policy</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          We ship goods out to Kenya every week on Friday by Air. If your order
          contains one item, we will ship it on the very next Friday after it
          arrives at our UK warehouse.
          <br />
          If your order contains multiple items, we will ship each item on
          Friday after it arrives at our UK warehouse. Therefore items that
          arrive at our UK warehouse early will be delivered to you earlier.
          <br />
          If the items in your order are related or are used together (e.g. a
          laptop and a laptop bag), we may wait for all items to arrive and then
          ship them to you together. If you require any clarification about our
          shipping policy, kindly email us at info@kenyaexports.co.uk
