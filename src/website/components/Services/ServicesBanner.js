        <h4>Send By Sea</h4>
        <p>
          Apart from the items on the price list, we charge everything else at
          £2.95 per kilo + £20 handling fee. The price is inclusive of all
          customs charges, you
          <br /> only need to collect your cargo from our warehouse or have it
          delivered for an extra fee.
        </p>
        <h4> Volumetric Weight</h4>
        <p>
          Although not very common, very large items with a light overall weight
          can be charged according to the space they take up in a container. In
          these
          <br /> cases, volumetric weight or dimensional (Dim) weight is used to
          calculate the shipment cost.
        </p>
        <h4> Note</h4>
        <p>
          We prefer customers to be responsible for the packaging of items being
          sent in suitable packaging material. Flat screen display (LCDs,
          Plasma’s and
          <br /> Computer Monitors) are specially packed and handled with care.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now would prefer for the items to be packed into suitable suitcases
          or strong boxes. We provide boxes for sale please contact us for
          purchases and
          <br /> delivery of boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          PLEASE NOTE!! we are not sending used or new fridges, car batteries,
          fireworks, fire extinguishers or insecticides or any sort of chemicals
          BY SEA.
        </p>
        <h4>Consolidation &amp; Packaging </h4>
        <p>
          As a company, we understand that smart packaging techniques can lead
          to significant cost savings. We are happy to pass on those savings to
          you..
        </p>
        <p>
          Consolidation is a process by which we safely combine multiple
          products belonging to one customer into a single package, wherever
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, if you buy a pair of shoes, a shirt and a pair of
          headphones from three different online stores, each product will
          arrive at our U.K.
          <br /> Warehouse in a separate package. Shipping them to your
          destination separately will result in unnecessarily high shipping
          charges. KenExports will
          <br /> therefore combine all three products into one package, wherever
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This efficient repackaging could save you as much as 80% in shipping
          costs. Package consolidation services are absolutely free for all our
          customers.
